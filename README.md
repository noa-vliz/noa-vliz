# About Me

Hello there! I'm noa, also known as noa-vliz or chocolatey. I'm a technology enthusiast who enjoys tinkering with various tools and systems.

## What I Do
- Playing around with the Rust programming language
- Configuring and customizing Emacs and Neovim
- Writing fiction in my spare time

## My Environment
- **OS**: Dual-booting Arch Linux and Windows
- **Editor of choice**: Emacs
- **Alternative editor**: Neovim

## Tech Stack
- Rust
- Linux
- Emacs/Neovim
- Arch Linux
- Windows

I initially wanted to learn C but struggled with memory management and segmentation faults, so I switched to Rust. While I enjoy the language itself, I find the community can be a bit too zealous at times.

I'm passionate about setting up development environments and customizing my editors for optimal workflow. There's something deeply satisfying about crafting the perfect environment that suits your needs!
